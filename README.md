one way to run these files:
1- you must run a webserver solution like xampp, and start the apache servers.
2- the database used for this project is oracle sql, on oracle 10g express edition
3- put the file in htdocs of the xampp directory.
4- open the localhost of your webBrowser.
5- open the file : Project_Castle_Y1S1/phpFiles/RegistrationPage.php. 
6- in the directory Project_Castle_Y3S1\SQL_Files\Project_Castle(htdocs).sql the (User_) table must be run 
   on the database, then after that the (user_Profile_Pic) table must be run, these tables are designed for oracle database.
7- you must also have the oracle database 10g express edition.
8- make a user named PROJECT_CASTLE and make the password the same PROJECT_CASTLE.
9- after creating the user PROJECT_CASTLE, run the sql file in this order:
    1- USER_
    2- USER_PROFILE_PIC
    3- POST
    4- Post_Status
    5- User_Status
    6- you must create some data in the database to be properly run, and be seen, first by creating users
       then by adding questions that is chosen by the user as topics, if the topic was out of the users interests
       it won't be seen, this will be later worked on for improvments.
