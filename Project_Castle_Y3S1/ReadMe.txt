one way to run these files:
1- you must run a webserver solution like xampp, and start the apache servers.
2- put the file in htdocs of the xampp directory.
3- open the localhost of your webBrowser.
4- open the file : Project_Castle_Y1S1/phpFiles/RegistrationPage.php. 
5- in the directory Project_Castle_Y3S1\SQL_Files\Project_Castle(htdocs).sql the (User_) table must be run 
   on the database, then after that the (user_Profile_Pic) table must be run, these tables are designed for oracle database.
6- you must also have the oracle database 10g express edition.
7- make a user named PROJECT_CASTLE and make the password the same PROJECT_CASTLE.
8- after creating the user PROJECT_CASTLE, run the sql file in this order:
    1- USER_
    2- USER_PROFILE_PIC
    3- POST
    4- Post_Status
    5- you must create some data in the database to be properly run, and be seen, first by creating users
       then by adding questions that is chosen by the user as topics, if the topic was out of the users interests
       it won't be seen, this will be later worked on for improvments.

Programmer status and ongoing work:
	-10/4 leaving:
		while trying to create a recursion tree to understand the comment section using both php and javascript
		, you tried to create an async function to understand user input using prompt library in javascript.
		(it's better to save time by creating the comment section by only depending on each comment id individually than creating 			
		a tree.)

	-16/4 leaving 3am in the morning:
		you worked on creating the best comment section possible, and made more work on the tables of the database, and created 			
		the dynamic tables,also, it seems like now the comment section works well, used microsoft whiteboard and sketch book hard 			
		copies to do that, and you solved too many small problems, and tried connecting to oracle database to 
		create tables using shuffling strings, which was succefful, something to be proud about, even though it was small üòÅ.

    	-18/4 3am in the morning you left:
		didn't work on the project castle that much, but tried to remember file uploading, and did some tutorials in this period of time,
		next time try to do loging section with user profile picture uploading tutorials, and you did small parts of each project in your courses.

	-24/4 4am in the morning you left:
		worked on the simple CERD and created a data dictionary for it, also started working on simple LERD and finished 
		working on it, you can know create a the login system for your website, following the newfeed.

	-26/4 leaving 3:45am in the morning:
		you procceeded by creating project castle's table, but creating the first attribute which is the USER_, and reviewed the
		info about the javascript, and learned a little about jQuery library of javascript, and added some beautifying methods to
		the website .

	-27/4 leaving 5:30am in the morning:
		you worked on creating the interface for the Castle website project, and learned new ways of using css, although, 
		it was fun learning new javascript libraries like JQuery and created some good interface for the login system, but partly 
		finished.

	-28/4 leaving 6am in the morning:
		you worked on further understanding the css transitions, and for that you used the javascript codes for making your work
		easier, tried using Jquery, but why when you can do things, much more controlable using javascript codes itself? just 
		using javscript is fine for those anyway.

	-29/4 leaving 5am in the morning: 
		you tried hard to implement the ripple effect using css but failed, come back another time for that, and started working
		on the signing up part of the website, and this is all without php.

	
	-1/5 leaving 6am in the morning :
		need to understand the code to create a select element well designed using javascript, you went far into the code
		and understood a good portion of the code, so you're good to go, start working on it after 8 hours of rest, you 
		have to finish it quick, or you will be late, then continue on the login system.
	
	-4/5 leaving 5:30am in the morning:
		the past 2 to 3 days you didn't do that much but today you worked on the signup interface and reached a good conclusion,
 		you don't need to do exhausting interfaces for know,just creating a simple one is enough, and with time, you can create
		the necssary styles and animations, although, you can use the code for designing the select elements, since now you understood them
	
	-starting from 13/5 around 5am in the morning:
		you stoped those past days because of ramadan weakness, or better say lack of suger in your blood,now you're good to go, 
		in the login system, now the previous button works and takes the previous element of the signup to the login page, still
		too much are left, another move toward the end of the registration page, 

	-23/5 leaving in the evening around 7 pm:
		I made the buttons to toggle using classList, after serious of failed work on trying to send a value back to an addEventListener,
		and made the toggle using classList, meaning toggling specified class that we want it's value to be there, according 
		to that we will make the function run.

	-24/5 leaving at 12pm:
		the value in the topics input, was not reaching the php file, after serious works on .textContent and .innerHTML, 
		i was able to make the value appear using .value in the php file, but know it works after using .innerHTML another way
		and using string functions like .slice() and .substring() and swap methods, anyway, we can send back the specified values 
		to the php file.

    -26/5 leaving at half to eleven pm:
        i was able to understand how to animaate the Topic holder section, and created the base of how it should be 
        excecuted.
    
    -27/5 leaving around 11 pm:
        today i was able to finally fix the animation problem of the topics section, it was not that hard, but i forgot some basics,
        which made it hard actually ü§£ü§£, it was like a holiday, so i celebrated through out the late night.
    
    -28/5 leaving at 5:30pm: 
        i think i was going at the pace of solving one problem a day, but now i actually do more, and i have to since we can't finish the 
        project at this pace, to day i solved page one's animation problems, and we are good togo üòÅ, i think i just realized the great problems
        are yet to come, i left because of a hard headache.
        
	-29/5 :
        not so much ongoing was done, actually close to nothing.
    
    -1/6 left at night:
         i was able to give error handlers for the signup page, and finished the task completely, now i have to deal with the 
         backend problem of signing up, and now i know how to connect to a database using javascript ajax.
    
    -6/6 started again after 2 nearly 3 days of weakness:
        these past 2 days, my whole body was just a mess, i was able to recover, and get some energy back, and guess what?
        now i know how to solve the connection between php and javascript üòé, came back stronger.
    
    -9/6 :
        solved the Email Problem, the ajax call was one step behind of the other functions, using jquery himself üòé, 
        that was 2 days of struggle.
    
    -12/6 :
        working on the news feed these past 2 days, still didn't reach the crucial commenting section üòù.

        1am left: the overwelming amount of construction, or i can say trying to nest divs inside each other, 
            and trying to make sense of them, is killing me ü§§, i feel like i'm in a sea or something, but still,
            i need to figure out how this sort of answer section must be protrayed.
    27/6 :
        4pm: i think i can see that the answer and reply section design came to and end, but, what the?
            but i think it works.
